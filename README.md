This generates the pages for my website "CPU Graveyard", for my CPU collection.  https://happytrees.org/chips

Feel free to use it to make you own. Just change the color scheme, and name to avoid confusion.

It reads CSV spreadsheets and generates pages for each chip, manufactures, and families, as well as interconnected categories.
